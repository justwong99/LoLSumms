# LoLSumms

LoLSumms was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. LoLSumms also uses a server created by Python to access Riot Games' API,
getting information to setup an HTML page suited to a user's game.vLoLSumms is a tool that assists League of Legends players who are 
in a game by timing the enemy teams' summoner spells. LoLSumms is used by searching a player's summoner name while they are in an ongoing
game. By clicking on the spell's icon when an enemy champion was seen using the spell, a countdown timer starts, so you would know when
the enemy champion has the spell available.
